# Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks 
This repository is meant to provide foundations for Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Network. It contains a [presentation](https://github.com/anoopkdcs/DLwithCNN/blob/main/presentation/DLwithCNN.pdf) that illustrates the theoretical concepts and a set of sample programs to understand the working of Deep Neural Networks. All the programs are implemented using [Keras](https://keras.io/) Deep Learning Library.
